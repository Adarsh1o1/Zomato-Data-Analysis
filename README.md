# 🥘 Zomato Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project explores and analyzes the **Zomato Restaurants Dataset** to uncover insights about restaurant costs, ratings, and popularity trends across different locations.  
It demonstrates end-to-end **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization** using Python libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess messy real-world restaurant data.  
- Standardize and convert inconsistent columns (e.g., ratings, costs).  
- Handle missing data gracefully.  
- Explore relationships between cost, rating, and location.  
- Visualize meaningful insights using Python data visualization tools.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains restaurant details such as:
- `name`
- `location`
- `rating`
- `votes`

## ⚙️ Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Handled missing values** in columns like `location` and `rating`.
2. **Converted cost values** (e.g., `'1,200' → 1200.0`).
3. Removed unwanted characters and formatted numeric columns properly.

## 📈 Data Analysis Performed
- Top-rated restaurants by city.  
- Most expensive restaurants.  
- Relationship between cost and rating.  
- Visualization of restaurant trends using bar plots and line plots.

## 🖼️ Visualizations
Some of the key plots generated:
- Bar charts for average cost comparison.
- Box plots to observe rating distributions.
- Dual-axis plots combining average cost and rating.
- Count plots to visualize restaurant distribution by location.

## 📊 Sample Insight
- Restaurants with higher costs often maintain a slightly better average rating, though not always directly proportional.

## 🧾Results Summary
- Cleaned and prepared dataset for analysis.
- Identified top restaurants by rating and cost.
- Visualized pricing and rating distribution across multiple dimensions.
- Derived actionable insights from data trends.

##💡Future Improvements
- Add sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
- Integrate interactive visualizations using Plotly or Power BI.
- Expand dataset to include more cities and cuisines.
